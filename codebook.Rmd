## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Below is a list of variables used:

## Variables used

Xtest <- variable to store the read in x_test.txt file 
XtestNames <- variable to store the read in features.txt file
XtestNamesTranspose <- transposed 'XtestNames'
XtestWithName <- a new data table by combining XtestNamesTranspose with Xtest
ytest <- variable to store the read in y_test.txt file
testdata <- a new data table by combining XtestWithName and ytest
subjecttest <- variable to store the read in subject_test.txt file
testdatacomplete <- a new data table by combining 'testdata' and 'subjecttest'

Xtrain <- variable to store the read in x_train.txt file
XtrainWithName <- a new data table by combining Xtrain and XtestNamesTranspose
ytrain <- variable to store the read in y_train.txt file
traindata <- new data table, combined 'XtrainWithName' and 'ytrain'
subjecttrain <- variable to store read in subject_train.txt file
traindatacomplete <- a new data table, combined 'traindata' and 'subjecttrain' 

fulldataset <- combined 'traindatacomplete' and 'testdatacomplete' into a new data.table
fulldatasetcomplete <- added activity description column

## The data files used

X_test.txt
y_test.txt
subject_test.txt
X_train.txt
y_train.txt
features.txt

## Transformations used to clean up data
Transposed the features.txt so can add as column name
```{r}
XtestNames <- read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt")
XtestNames <- as.data.table(XtestNames) ##make it a data.table, then can use dcast and melt to transpose it below. Otherwise there's some warning message if try to transpose a data.frame
XtestNamesTranspose <- dcast(melt(XtestNames, id.vars = "V1"), variable ~ V1) ##transpose XtestNames data.table
XtestNamesTranspose$variable <- NULL ## remove first column, it's non relevant data 
XtestWithName <- rbind(XtestNamesTranspose, Xtest, use.names = FALSE) ## combine by row the name and the test data
```

Used cbind and rbind to combine data, below is a cbind example
```{r}
testdatacomplete <- cbind(subjecttest, testdata)

```

Used ifelse() to create a list for the activity descriptions
```{r}
## Use ifelse() to create a vector with the proper descriptive activity
activitydescriptions <- ifelse(fulldataset$activity == 1, "WALKING", ifelse(
        fulldataset$activity == 2, "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", ifelse(
                fulldataset$activity == 3, "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", ifelse(
                        fulldataset$activity == 4, "SITTING", ifelse(
                                fulldataset$activity == 5, "STANDING", "LAYING"
                        )
                )
        )
))
```

Used lapply to convert the data.table columns into numeric so could calculate the mean
```{r}
convertfulldatasetcomplete <- lapply(fulldatasetcomplete, function(x) as.numeric(as.character(x))) ##make the columns numeric while retaining header
t <- as.data.table(convertfulldatasetcomplete) ##convert it into a data.table, the lapply returned a list
activitysubjectdata <- aggregate(.~ activity + subject, t, mean, na.action = na.pass) ##there are NA's, then it will throw no rows error...

```
